# find all '&â€¦;' entity sequences in the text and output a list.
# the micra text used SGML/ISO-8879 encodings, plus many nonstandard ones.

# however the webfont.txt document also states:
# | Note that the symbols used here are in some cases abbreviations
# | (for compactness) of the ISO 8879 recommended symbols.

# webfont.txt also states that an escape syntax '<xx/' is used;
# while these appear in the PG 29765.utf8 text,
# this syntax is not present in the 0.50 texts, as shown by the assertion;
# presumably they were converted to entity syntax.
